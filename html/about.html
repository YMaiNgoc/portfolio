      Hi, I’m <strong>Y Mai Ngọc</strong>, a <strong>Front-end Developer</strong> 
      who enjoys building clean, modern, and user-friendly web interfaces.
      I care about layout structure, color harmony, and creating smooth user experiences

      I currently focus on developing my skills with 
      <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>React</strong>.
      I enjoy turning designs into real, responsive interfaces and writing clear,
      maintainable code that is easy to understand and scale.
